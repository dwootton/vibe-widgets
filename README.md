## Why Vibe Widget?

**→ Speak Human, Get Code**
Describe your viz in plain English. The AI writes production-ready React. You get interactive widgets. Everyone's happy.

**→ Widgets That Talk to Each Other**  
Select points in one chart → instantly updates another. Paint terrain → watch it render in 3D. It's like your visualizations are texting each other.

**→ Eat Any Data Format**  
Pandas DataFrames? Obviously. But also: CSV, JSON, NetCDF, XML, PDF tables, seismic data (ISF), scraped web pages, live streams. If it's data, we'll visualize it.

**→ Actually Custom Stuff**  
Not limited to "bar chart but blue this time." Want a 3D solar system? An interactive game board? A terrain painter? Just ask. The AI builds it from scratch.

**→ Smart Caching**  
Same description + data = instant load from cache. Different description = new widget, stored separately. It's like git for visualizations.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install vibe-widget
```

Or with `uv`:
```bash
uv pip install vibe-widget
```

Set your API key (pick your AI flavor):
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'    # for Claude
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'       # for GPT
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-key'       # for Gemini
```

---

## Quickstart (Seriously, It's This Easy)

```python
import pandas as pd
import vibe_widget as vw

# Pick your AI (optional, defaults to Claude)
vw.config(model="gemini")  # or "openai" or "anthropic"

# Got data?
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Describe what you want
widget = vw.create(
    "bar chart of sales by region, sorted high to low, with tooltips",
    df
)
```

The AI will analyze your data, write React code, validate it, fix any bugs, and render it. You just chill.

---

## Real Examples

**Basic Viz**
```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'planet': ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars'],
    'distance': [0.39, 0.72, 1.0, 1.52],
    'mass': [0.055, 0.815, 1.0, 0.107]
})

widget = vw.create(
    "3D scatter plot: distance vs mass, size by mass, make it spinny",
    df
)
```

**Scrape the Web**
```python
widget = vw.create(
    "show Hacker News stories as cards, let me sort by score",
    "https://news.ycombinator.com"
)
```

**Extract PDF Tables**
```python
widget = vw.create(
    "interactive table from this PDF with sorting",
    "report.pdf"
)
```

**Climate Data (NetCDF)**
```python
widget = vw.create(
    "heatmap of sea surface temps, zoomable",
    "ocean_data.nc"
)
```

**Linked Widgets (The Cool Part)**
```python
# Widget 1: Scatter with selection
scatter = vw.create(
    "scatter plot with brush selection",
    df,
    exports={"selected": "indices of selected points"}
)

# Widget 2: Histogram that reacts
histogram = vw.create(
    "histogram highlighting selected points from scatter",
    df,
    imports={"selected": scatter}
)

# Select in scatter → histogram updates instantly ✨
```

## The Important Bits

**Data Handling**  
→ Auto-detects formats and types  
→ Samples huge datasets (>100k rows) smartly  
→ Supports CSV, JSON, NetCDF, XML, ISF, PDF, web scraping  

**Code Generation**  
→ LLM writes React components  
→ Validates and auto-fixes errors  
→ Iterates until it works  

**Widget Communication**  
→ Export/import system for state sharing  
→ Automatic sync between widgets  
→ Built on Jupyter widgets (ipywidgets)  

**Caching**  
→ Same input = instant cache hit  
→ Organized in `.vibewidget/` folder  
→ Track all your widget versions  

---

## API (The Only Function You Need)

```python
widget = vw.create(
    description="natural language description of your viz",
    data=df,                        # DataFrame, file path, or URL
    model="anthropic",              # "anthropic", "openai", or "gemini"
    exports={"trait": "description"},   # what this widget shares
    imports={"trait": other_widget},    # what this widget receives
)
```

**Description Tips**  
Be specific: "3D scatter with rotation" beats "show the data"  
Mention interactions: "with hover tooltips", "clickable legend"  
Style it: "dark theme", "sorted by value", "highlight outliers"  

**Data Sources**  
→ Pandas DataFrame (the classic)  
→ File paths: `.csv`, `.json`, `.nc`, `.xml`, `.isf`, `.pdf`  
→ URLs (we'll scrape it)  
→ `None` (for widgets driven purely by imports)  

**Model Selection**  
```python
vw.config(model="openrouter")                 # uses the standard default (see vw.models())
vw.config(model="openrouter", mode="premium") # uses the premium default

# or per-widget
widget = vw.create("...", df, model="openai/gpt-5.1-codex")

# see all options
vw.models()  # prints defaults + pinned options, and returns a dict-like object (concise repr in notebooks)
vw.models(show="all")  # prints a longer live list too
```

## How It Works

```
You type English
    ↓
DataProcessor figures out your data
    ↓
AI writes React code (via LLM providers)
    ↓
Code validated & tested
    ↓
WidgetStore caches it
    ↓
You get a working visualization
```

**Architecture**:
- **core.py** - Main VibeWidget class and `create()` function
- **DataLoader()** - Unified data loading (CSV, JSON, NetCDF, PDF, web, etc.)
- **agentic.py** - Orchestrates LLM code generation and validation
- **providers/** - Multi-provider LLM support (Anthropic, OpenAI, Gemini)
- **util.py** - Clean utility functions for JSON serialization & trait handling
- **widget_store.py** - Smart caching system
