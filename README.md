## Why Vibe Widget?

**→ Speak Human, Get Code**
Describe your viz in plain English. The AI writes production-ready React. You get interactive widgets. Everyone's happy.

**→ Widgets That Talk to Each Other**  
Select points in one chart → instantly updates another. Paint terrain → watch it render in 3D. It's like your visualizations are texting each other.

**Universal Data Support**  
Works with DataFrames, CSV, JSON, NetCDF, XML, PDF tables, ISF seismic data, web pages, and more. Intelligent data loading handles format detection and preprocessing automatically.

**Widget Composition**  
Create interactive dashboards where widgets communicate through a simple export/import system. Select data in one chart and watch others update instantly.

**Highly Customizable**  
Not limited to standard charts. Generate 3D visualizations, interactive games, custom UI components, or anything React can render.

**Smart Caching**  
Generated widgets are automatically cached. Same description and data structure loads instantly from disk without regenerating.

**Multi-Model Support**  
Choose between Claude (Anthropic), GPT (OpenAI), Gemini (Google), or any OpenRouter-supported model.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install vibe-widget
```

Set your API key for your preferred AI provider:

```bash
# Choose one based on your preferred model
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY='your-key'    # for Claude (default)
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'       # for GPT
export GEMINI_API_KEY='your-key'       # for Gemini
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY='your-key'   # for OpenRouter models
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
import pandas as pd
import vibe_widget as vw

# Load your data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# Create a visualization with natural language
widget = vw.create(
    "bar chart of sales by region, sorted high to low, with tooltips",
    df
)
```

That's it. The AI analyzes your data, generates React code, validates it, and renders an interactive widget.

### Configuration

```python
# Choose your AI model (optional, defaults to Claude)
vw.config(model="gemini")  # or "openai", "anthropic", "openrouter"

# Or specify per widget
widget = vw.create("scatter plot", df, model="openai/gpt-4-turbo")

# View available models
vw.models()
```

---

## Examples

### Basic Visualizations

```python
df = pd.DataFrame({
    'planet': ['Mercury', 'Venus', 'Earth', 'Mars'],
    'distance': [0.39, 0.72, 1.0, 1.52],
    'mass': [0.055, 0.815, 1.0, 0.107]
})

widget = vw.create(
    "3D scatter plot: distance vs mass, size by mass, with rotation controls",
    df
)
```

### Web Scraping

```python
widget = vw.create(
    "show Hacker News stories as cards with sorting by score",
    "https://news.ycombinator.com"
)
```

### PDF Extraction

```python
widget = vw.create(
    "extract tables from PDF and display as interactive sortable table",
    "report.pdf"
)
```

### Climate Data (NetCDF)

```python
widget = vw.create(
    "heatmap of sea surface temperatures with zoom controls",
    "ocean_data.nc"
)
```

### Linked Widgets

Create dashboards where widgets communicate:

```python
# Widget 1: Scatter with brush selection
scatter = vw.create(
    "scatter plot with brush selection tool",
    df,
    exports={"selected": "indices of selected points"}
)

# Widget 2: Histogram that reacts to selection
histogram = vw.create(
    "histogram with highlighted bars for selected data",
    df,
    imports={"selected": scatter}
)
```

When you select points in the scatter plot, the histogram automatically highlights corresponding data.

### Iterative Refinement

```python
# Create initial widget
v1 = vw.create("basic scatter plot", df)

# Refine it
v2 = vw.revise("add color by category", v1)

# Refine further
v3 = vw.revise("make points larger and add tooltips", v2)
```

More examples available in [`examples/`](examples/) directory.

## API Reference

### `create()`

Create a new widget from scratch.

```python
widget = vw.create(
    description: str,           # Natural language description
    data=None,                  # DataFrame, file path, URL, or None
    model=None,                 # AI model to use (optional)
    show_progress=True,         # Show generation progress
    exports=None,               # Dict of {trait_name: description}
    imports=None,               # Dict of {trait_name: source_widget}
    config=None                 # Config object (optional)
)
```

**Parameters:**

- `description`: Natural language description of your visualization
  - Be specific: "3D scatter with rotation" beats "show the data"
  - Mention interactions: "with hover tooltips", "clickable legend"
  - Include styling: "dark theme", "sorted by value", "highlight outliers"

- `data`: Your data source
  - `pd.DataFrame`: Direct DataFrame
  - `str` or `Path`: File path (CSV, JSON, NetCDF, XML, PDF, etc.)
  - `str` (URL): Web page to scrape
  - `None`: For widgets driven purely by imports

- `model`: AI model selection
  - `"anthropic"` / `"claude"`: Claude models (default)
  - `"openai"` / `"gpt"`: GPT models
  - `"gemini"`: Google Gemini
  - `"openrouter"`: OpenRouter service
  - Specific model: `"openai/gpt-4-turbo"`

- `exports`: State this widget shares with others
  - Format: `{"trait_name": "description of what this represents"}`
  - Example: `{"selected": "indices of selected data points"}`

- `imports`: State this widget receives from others
  - Format: `{"trait_name": source_widget or source_widget.trait}`
  - Example: `{"selected": scatter_widget}`

### `revise()`

Build upon an existing widget.

```python
widget = vw.revise(
    description: str,           # Description of changes
    source,                     # Widget, ComponentReference, ID, or path
    data=None,                  # Optional new data
    model=None,                 # Optional model override
    show_progress=True,
    exports=None,
    imports=None,
    config=None
)
```

**Source types:**
- `VibeWidget`: Existing widget variable
- `ComponentReference`: `widget.component_name`
- `str`: Widget ID from cache (e.g., "abc123-v1")
- `Path`: File path to widget JS file

### `config()`

Configure global settings.

```python
vw.config(
    model="anthropic",          # Default model
    mode="standard",            # "standard" or "premium"
    api_key=None               # Optional API key override
)
```

### `models()`

View available models.

```python
vw.models()                    # Show defaults and pinned models
vw.models(show="all")          # Show all available models
vw.models(verbose=False)       # Quiet mode
```

## How It Works

```
Natural Language → Data Processing → AI Code Generation → Validation → Caching → Interactive Widget
```

**Architecture:**

- **Core Module** (`core.py`): Main VibeWidget class, `create()` and `revise()` functions
- **Data Loading** (`data_tools.py`): Universal data loader supporting 15+ formats
- **Agentic Orchestration** (`agentic.py`): Coordinates LLM code generation and validation
- **Multi-Provider LLMs** (`providers/`): Support for Anthropic, OpenAI, Google, OpenRouter
- **Validation Tools** (`code_tools.py`): Syntax checking and code validation
- **Widget Store** (`widget_store.py`): Smart caching and version management
- **Code Parser** (`code_parser.py`): Stream parsing for real-time generation feedback

**Key Features:**

- **Smart Data Handling**: Auto-detects formats, handles large datasets via sampling
- **Code Generation**: LLM generates React components with validation and auto-repair
- **Widget Communication**: Export/import system for reactive dashboards
- **Caching**: Hash-based caching prevents redundant generation
- **Error Recovery**: Automatic error detection and fixing for runtime issues
